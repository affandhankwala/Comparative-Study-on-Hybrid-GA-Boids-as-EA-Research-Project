## Abstract
Optimization of continuous real-value functions involves minimizing a function over a specific landscape. Evolutionary computation and swarm intelligence offer an efficient solution to handle these complex environments through established methods such as genetic algorithms (GAs) and particle swarm optimizations (PSOs). This paper introduces Reynolds’s bird-oid (Boids) flock-simulating particles into the realm of continuous function optimization in the hybrid GA-Boids algorithm. Contrary to our hypothesis, this algorithm did not demonstrate statistically higher performance than our other algorithms in our three continuous evaluation functions, but demonstrated almost superior performance in the highest dimension. We believe this may be due to some clashing in the GA-Boids phases that is overlooked in higher dimensions, and would propose further research into performance in
said higher dimensions.
